There is a playing card deck, (2 decks stacked, total 104 cards). 
The dealer deals the cards to the players one player at a time. 
    If the player value goes above 21, bust
    If the player value is exactly 21, blackjack (2.5x)
    If the player's value(s) are under 21: 
        Compare the values of Player1 and Player2, and return who is the winner.
